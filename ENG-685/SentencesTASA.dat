1: That the power of taxing it by the states may be exercised so as to destroy it, is too obvious to be denied.
2: None ever penned a manifesto as stirring as the one that appeared in the first issue of the liberator, and no other abolitionist document is so well remembered.
3: With slavery flourishing in the south and spreading to the southwest, few masters would tolerate criticism, however moderate, of the `peculiar institution.'
4: But most northerners were indifferent about slavery, `slumbering in the lap of moral death,' at the time the liberator first appeared.
5: Like most abolitionists he was a pacifist, and the new england antislavery society that he organized promised not to `operate on the existing relations of society by other than peaceful and lawful means.'
6: By nailing the flag of liberal divorce laws to the staff of woman's rights, mrs.

13: It was a losing fight until conscience joined forces with fear and self-interest against it.
14: When it is practised in dealing with the slum, there will shortly be no slum.
15: When a man is drowning, the thing to do is to pull him out of the water; afterward there will be time for talking it over.
16: We got at it the other way in dealing with our social problems.
17: As the president-elect planned his inaugural address, economic machinery seemed to be slowing to a standstill.
18: One-quarter of the wage-earners were unable to find work to support themselves or their families, and only one-quarter of these unemployed were receiving even paltry relief funds.
19: A fourth of the farmers were losing or had lost their farms.
20: `did you ever dream of anything like the docility of the american people under the crushing burden of these times?'
21: The answer to white's query was that they were waiting to see what the roosevelt administration could bring to them.

31: James brown, a widely respected student of appalachian society, says appalachia is a politically defined region, making obvious reference to the portion of the united states presently considered appalachian by the appalachian regional commission.
32: In the section that follows, we will present three distinctly defined regions, each describing a geopolitical and social region, some or all of which has at one time been called appalachia.
33: Not surprisingly ohioans, albeit included in the appalachian region these past eight years, do not appear to be appalachian using the weller characterization.
34: The country was exceedingly rough, but he found a couple, james and priscilla davis, living near the mouth of defeated branch.

37: In 1975, a recession year, it worsened abruptly, rising from 5.4 to 8.7 percent of the labor force, again surpassing the national unemployment rate.
38: So far as the survey data are indicative, however, shifting the benefits from the individual to the community and its institutions only slightly reduced the support accorded federal subsidization programs -LRB- table 19.3 -RRB-.
39: Most respondents -LRB- 51 percent -RRB- agreed that in general the government was doing `enough' for the people.
40: Significantly, however, more than twice as many thought the government was doing `too little' -LRB- 21 percent -RRB- as thought it was doing `too much.'
41: The remaining respondents in both cases were either unsure or unwilling to voice an opinion.
42: [ Olga10 .05.02 ] [ P # = 2 ] [ DRP = 75.774061 ] [ SocialStudies = Yes ] in nearly all respects, including their denomination affiliations, leaders were manifestly nonsectarians.

45: Helen lewis, relying heavily on robert blauner's analysis of colonialism in relation to black americans, provides the most informative research in this regard.
46: It can be said, however, that the colonial analogy is gaining attention and respectability as more becomes known about who controls the resources of appalachia.
47: Appalachia, covering an irregularly shaped area of 195,000 square miles, has a great deal of mountainous or upland hilly terrain which differs substantially from the surrounding land in use and economic development.
48: Settlement in the stream valleys and floodplains of appalachia is endangered by the region's major natural hazard, `flooding' -LRB- general and flash -RRB-.

53: People perceive events and difficulties as `happening' to them, rather than as the direct result of the individual's vulnerable situation or his actions.
54: Each region, a contiguous grouping of units, has characteristics which make it different from surrounding areas or regions.
55: Formal regions may be defined by their physical, social, economic, or cultural characteristics or by some combination of these characteristics depending upon the purpose of purposes of the definition.
56: When each variable is plotted independently a `spaghetti bowl' of overlapping borders often emerges and only the core or heart of the region remains circumscribed within all the borders.
57: Such regions are often too small, or are otherwise inadequate, for use in planning economic development or service delivery.
58: Thus a logical and consistent means of defining boundaries is needed so that territorial units can be rationally fitted into or deleted from the region being delimited.
59: The parts of a functional region are usually heterogeneous in character but their functions are interrelated.

61: A new dimension to tearing up the country is being done in this area.
62: The daniel boone parkway toll road is being constructed and machines are seen everywhere.
63: Theory dealing with appalachian transition suggests that because of these changes, because of increased interaction and communication with the outside, the isolation and in turn the autonomy of the rural society system began decreasing rapidly.
64: [ Olga10 .10.03 ] [ P # = 3 ] [ DRP = 72.694925 ] [ SocialStudies = Yes ] the holiness churches are primarily concerned with attaining perfection and holiness itself.
65: Most of them believe in the trinity, original sin, salvation through christ, the infallibility and divine nature of the scriptures, and the blessings of the holy spirit, including divine healing and speaking in tongues.
66: Most are premillenarians, believing that the visible return of christ will precede his reign of a thousand years on earth.
67: Churches which honor the practice believe that god confers certain powers upon the believers, divine healing, speaking in tongues, drinking of deadly poisons, and casting out devils, as well as handling serpents.
68: The annointing feeling varies from person to person, a numbness of the hands, a tingling somewhere, a great calmness, an inner voice, but no matter what the manifestation, believers recognize it.
69: Social scientists of all kinds, including economists, have written libraries full of books and articles about what goes on inside the household, but these writings receive little attention in traditional microeconomics.
70: These factors are the basic inputs of labor, capital, and natural resources used in producing all goods and services.
71: Labor includes the productive contribution of people working with their minds and their muscles.
72: Capital means all productive inputs created by people, including tools, industrial equipment, structures, improvements to land, and even such intangibles as computer programs.
73: As a second example, consider regulations prohibiting the production and sale of marijuana.
74: These regulations are not entirely successful in keeping buyers and sellers apart, but they make it enormously more costly for them to get together.
75: Users find it difficult, sometimes impossible, to get accurate information on the origin and quality of the product they are buying.

84: Note, however, that the actual budget surplus shows little of what was going on during the 1960-1964 period.
85: There are some obvious measurement problems, for example, determining just what level of employment is high and how to adjust for interactions among employment, income, prices, and interest rates.

88: Decisions of the committee regarding changes in the fed's security holdings are carried out through the open market trading desk of the federal reserve bank of new york.
89: In 1980, hoping to aid the fed in its efforts to achieve monetary stability, congress passed the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act.
90: Traditionally, the fed has viewed borrowing at the discount window as a privilege rather than a right.
91: Reserve funds have been made available only for the purpose of correcting short-run reserve deficiencies and, in exceptional cases, for alleviating the longer-term liquidity problems of troubled institutions.
92: An increase in the discount rate, other things being equal, will encourage borrowing at the discount window and will tend to increase the money supply.
93: The fed's ability to affect the volume of borrowed reserves by altering the discount rate is an important instrument of monetary control.
94: In addition to imposing an explicit cost in the form of the discount rate on banks that borrow at the discount window, the fed can also impose significant implicit costs on borrowers in the form of administrative pressure.
95: Aggregate nominal demand can be calculated for any point on the diagram by multiplying real gnp for a given year by the price index for the same year and then dividing by 100.
96: By 1933 nominal gnp had fallen to $ 55.8 billion, shifting the aggregate real demand curve far to the left.
97: Why does n't adding one percentage point to the growth rate of real output cut unemployment by a full percentage point over a year's time?
98: Firms hiring new workers must bear the costs of advertising for applicants and screening them when they arrive.
99: Firms laying off workers also encounter transactions costs.
100: Because of these transactions costs, then, firms tend to `hoard' labor during business downturns by cutting workers ' hours or finding make-work rather than laying workers off.
101: And during temporary upswings, they may find it cheaper to put workers on overtime, even at time-and-a-half wages, rather than go to the trouble of recruiting new workers.
102: During a business upswing, when firms are creating new jobs at a rapid rate, some previously unemployed workers find employment.
103: There the inflation rate is 1 percent, and the unemployment rate has fallen by 1 percent, giving a 3 percent real growth rate.
104: There the inflation rate is 3 percent, and unemployment has fallen by three percentage points, giving a 9 percent rate of real growth.
105: Adding the rate of inflation to the rate of real growth tells us that point b' could be reached only if nominal gnp grew at 12 percent rather than at the assumed 8 percent.
106: These results are so encouraging that the blues repeat exactly the same policy and maintain the 8 percent growth rate of nominal gnp in year 2.
107: The phillips curve shifts because, after experiencing 2 percent inflation in year 1, firms and workers expect continued 2 percent inflation in year 2.
108: Hunger comes in varying degrees.
109: These are hardly the traits required for the labor forces of poor countries struggling to achieve development.
110: It is natural to think of overpopulation causing hunger, with a malthusian growth of numbers of people outstripping food production.
111: Absolute advantage turns out to be unimportant in determining patterns of trade.
112: Spanish merchants in the port will have been used to giving 2 tons of grain, or its equivalent, for a ton of fish.

116: Solar heating of schools and swimming pools is already becoming feasible, but solar energy is not yet capable of generating electricity at a price competitive with other sources of energy.
117: Fortunately, existing structures can be `retrofitted' with solar equipment, thus greatly enlarging the potential of solar heating.
118: Still, there is no point to duplicating solar research now going forward all around the world.
119: And we can go overboard in providing tax credits and subsidies for business and home solar installations.

122: When the economy is suffering from both recession and inflation -LRB- as happens with increasing frequency -RRB-, a tax-based income policy -LRB- tip -RRB- may be considered as an alternative to a general tax cut.
123: The tax cuts would help revive a flagging economy while simultaneously acting as a brake on inflation and inflation-producing wage increases.
124: Since these corporations and their labor unions often set the price and wage patterns for the rest of the economy, the policy might serve dual purposes without having to create a massive bureaucracy to oversee the program.

128: Almost 80 percent of the jobs do not require a college degree, but well over 40 percent of our young people are going to college.
129: By the late 1970s, larger numbers of erstwhile college-bound youth, in fact, were deciding that college was not for them after all.
130: Vocational education has long been the `depressed area' of secondary education, attracting less competent teaching personnel than other fields.
131: Many programs continue obsolete training facilities and are plagued by an academic snobbery that persists in relegating vo-ed to the bottom of the prestige ladder. nor would low-income people be subjected to the indignities of having welfare workers prescribe their spending pattern, as is sometimes done when welfare departments think welfarees are misspending their welfare checks.
132: Professional social workers could devote their full attention to counseling and rehabilitation of disorganized low-income families instead of slaving over endless mounds of dreary paperwork.
133: Since nit would replace the existing complex welfare system, its costs would be politically practicable if payments were set at reasonable levels.
134: An adequate minimum income for persons in the south would not be high enough for those living in the high cost-of-living cities in the north.
135: Students who choose to spend a few months, or years, after high school or college enjoying a carefree life on an `economy budget' before `settling down' would also be eligible for benefits.

143: The pentagon is also assembling the much-disputed neutron bomb, designed to stop a massive soviet attack in western europe by killing soldiers en masse while drastically reducing property damage and minimizing radiation fallout on civilians.
144: Electroncially guided antitank artillery and missiles are also being planned, since a major breakthrough here could go far toward neutralizing the soviets ' heavy advantage in tank forces.
145: Hispanics are joining in large numbers, also.
146: The draft army, fallows believes, should use the lottery, giving all the youth of america an equal opportunity to serve or not to serve.
147: On the other hand, some people believe that our forefathers came to america to escape being conscripted into the army.
148: But these terms are subject to such wildly varying interpretations, depending on the tastes of the interpreter, that they are of little value to a court or a jury.
149: Indeed the national commission on obsecenity and pornography after surveying the available evidence and conducting numerous experiments on pornography's effects, concluded that scientific research had failed to establish that pornography adversely affected adults.
150: As for `corrupting' the morals of the people, critics of censorship insist that moral values are formed overwhelmingly by the family and the schools, with pornography having no more than a minute impact.
151: That is part of what being an adult in a free society should mean.
152: We know that a large percentage of young people from 15 to 19 years of age are passing through a rebellious stage, challenging parental restraints and parental values.
153: At a time when they are eager to demonstrate their adulthood and independence by flouting parental standards, pornography and other influences that beckon them to dubious sexual adventures are sometimes particularly appealing.
154: Defenders of the sexual revolution typically appraise it from the standpoint of those presumed to have the greatest maturity and judgment in coping with the freedom it offers.
155: So far, however, the feminists seem to have been intimidated by the aclu and its supporters, and have stopped short of declaring full-scale war on the pornographic industry.
156: Themselves crusading for human liberation, they do not want to seem unappreciative of the supposedly stern requirements of the first amendment.
157: Jamison's opening address was a call to action.
158: State flags were in full display, and the streets were gay with bunting.
159: On the store fronts hung paintings of wharves piled high with cotton and a harbor bristling with masts, visions of the blessings expected of secession.
160: Crowds of excited citizens lined the streets and packed the squares leading to institute hall, where the convention first met.
161: But leaders of the secession movement had in mind from the beginning the formation of a southern nation embodying their ideals on slavery, economic conservatism, and state rights.
162: On the day that south carolina withdrew from the union, robert barnwell rhett introduced a resolution calling for a convention of southern states for the purpose of forming a national government.
163: Possibly at the urging of the south carolinians, the alabama secession convention invited the other withdrawing states to send representatives to montgomery to organize the confederate states of america.
164: A variety of other professions was represented, including physicians, businessmen, teachers, college presidents, editors, and ministers of the gospel.

166: [ Olga13 .01.03 ] [ P # = 2 ] [ DRP = 71.849379 ] [ SocialStudies = Yes ] the final weakness of the south was the institution of slavery.
167: The many serious weaknesses of the south were partially offset by certain advantages rising out of her own nature and the nature of the conflict that she waged.
168: The confederate army contained more than three hundred graduates of west point, including many who were considered the finest of the lot.
169: For example, according to the judeo-christian-islamic tradition, all living things were specially and individually created by god.
170: Even so, until very recently scientists continued the tradition of stressing how the extraordinary and superior attributes of the human animal place it in a special category, apart from other animals.
171: Scientists recognized humans to be animals, but possessing traits and talents that were thought to be fundamentally different from any qualities found among the `lower' forms of life.
172: Human behavior, on the other hand, was seen as being based on ideas and concepts that are socially learned and transmitted, rather than genetically inherited.
173: [ Olga14 .01.02 ] [ P # = 3 ] [ DRP = 74.440331 ] [ SocialStudies = Yes ] the concept of evolution made it possible to begin studying human nature systematically without resorting to theological dogma.
174: But they stoutly supported the principle of `psychic unity,' according to which all people have essentially the same mental capacities and potentials.
175: To them, evolution was a sequence leading from the simple to the complex, or the primitive to the advanced.
176: According to levi-strauss these universal principles are to be found in the structure of the processes of human thought.
177: Other structuralists have pursued the less ambitious task of trying to discover the structural operating principles of specific cultural systems.
178: Although this approach is useful in pointing out some of the cognitive underpinnings of social behavior, it does not explain why such principles exist.
179: This approach also treats cultural order as a given, and largely ignores the adaptive dimension of culture, by failing to link underlying structural principles with the physical and social environment.
180: Individuals who speak more than one language are relatively common in all societies, a fact that american students taking their first foreign-language class sometimes find amazing.
181: Amid such linguistic complexity, it is little wonder that filipinos commonly find themselves unable to understand what the majority of their fellow citizens are saying, thinking, or planning.
182: Because of such communication snarls, speakers of different philippine languages usually avoid visiting each other, eating together, forming friendships, marrying, or forming political alliances.
183: The type of agricultural production that has come to dominate the nontropical regions of the world, and that recently has been spreading into the tropics as well, is exemplified in the large-scale, mechanized grain farm.
184: Like plantations, grain farms focus upon growing only one or two crops, and the products are usually exported, or at least sold to relatively distant markets.
185: Unlike plantations, however, these large grain farms are capital rather than labor intensive, depending upon a small work force and large inputs of money in the form of fertilizers and mechanical equipment.
186: Among a group of these farms will be a small town that provides services, including banks, government administrators, mechanics, and often a contingent of rather poor laborers who depend upon periodic work on nearby farms.
187: On collective farms residential patterns tend to be more villagelike, the village serving as both service center and place of residence for the farmers.
188: A final subsistence pattern found in large-scale industrial societies is ranching.
189: In small-scale societies, people are automatically divided into sex groups that serve many purposes, such as carrying out the subsistence activitis delegated to their sex.
190: It helps to provide us with a sense of security, with roots, in a world that is otherwise always changing and in which we may often feel alienated.
191: Some of us delight in going through telephone books when stranded in strange towns or airports, looking for persons with whom we share surnames, and perhaps calling them to see if we are related.
192: Kinship also provides us with a sense of security by providing links to the past, through a variety of ancestors.
193: Many families have purchased from mail order firms coats of arms with an accompanying booklet telling of a few famous ancestors.
194: Being a descendant of an early settler in many parts of the country, even though the ancestor in question might have been a rather unsavory sort, can often be used to social advantage.
195: In societies where divorce is fairly common, individuals may enter in a series of marriages, marrying, divorcing, and marrying again, but still maintain only one spouse at a time.
196: The practice of having more than one spouse at the same time we call `polygamy.'
197: They might say, `why is this woman lashing our children?'
198: Rather than existing as a relatively isolated entity, a feudal system today is very much a part of the world system.
199: This integration of feudal systems into the modern world system has provided for the potential undoing of feudalism by presenting both lord and vassal with options.
200: For the lord, for example, there is the option of mechanized agriculture, of relying upon machines and a few wage laborers rather than a large number of subservient vassals.
201: The role of state governments has also been a factor, as most governments in recent years have taken a more active role in affairs influencing areas under feudal structures.
202: In the past when the state in peru, for example, exercised any influence over feudal areas, it was to support the `hacendado' -LRB- for instance, by sending troops to quell periodic revolts -RRB-.
203: The power and wealth of polynesian chiefs varied, with chiefs on some of the larger islands attaining considerable power and maintaining great social distance from commoners.
204: These titles, chiefs and talking chiefs, were inherited patrilineally.
205: Talking chiefs served as the ceremonial attendants of chiefs, although they were not necessarily inferior in status to them.
206: Both chiefs and talking chiefs occupied varying ranks in a hierarchy based upon presumed descent through male lines from a god or a legendary incident.
207: The annual tropical monsoons regularly isolate its scattered communities, which have come to depend on seagoing barges for food and goods and air services for travel.
208: Family and clan groups who had been living in crowded mission settlements decided to `go home' and reestablish small communities on their own lands.
209: Because ways of life associated with these societies are disappearing more rapidly every year, contemporary anthropologists share the concern of earlier anthropologists in recording these significant aspects of the human enterprise.
210: They feel a humanistic concern for those whose life-style is disappearing and a scientific desire to ensure taht we are aware of mankind's potentialities.
211: There remain many important lessons to be learned from studying people living in smaller, nonindustrial societies.
212: Anthropologists ' continuing interest in small-scale societies involves a different theoretical approach than in the past, however.
213: [ Olga15 .01.03 ] [ P # = 3 ] [ DRP = 67.442439 ] [ SocialStudies = Yes ] a number of inferences stem from this notion of the moral and rational nature of the individual.
214: Recent proclamations supporting human rights in the united nations and elsewhere, represent one of the oldest battle cries of liberalism.
215: Personal liberty consists of all those rights guaranteeing the individual protection against government.
216: The only way to define this positively is to state it as the right of individuals to think their own thoughts and learn in their own ways from experience with nobody impeding the process.
217: Ever since, socialist parties have been advocating the cause of socialism in a democratic setting with full respect for democratic institutions.
218: In so doing, they have been extending the pact between liberals and radical democrats further into what, in effect, has become a liberal-radical and democratic-socialist synthesis or, better, `democratic socialism.'
219: It is not only political parties but, even more so, the various interest groups and associations that make their demands known and that participate in policymaking.
220: In france, until almost 1980, the communists were by far the stronger, receiving solid working-class support, controlling the most powerful trade union, and having the ability to mobilize the public and the electorate.
221: The new socialist party moved clearly to the left, cooperating with the communists and advocating broad structural reforms and the nationalizations of about eleven key industries and virtually all banks.
